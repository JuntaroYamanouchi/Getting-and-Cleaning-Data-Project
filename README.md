Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
=================================


This repository contains the script run_analysis.R, which analyzes the supplied datasets and CodeBook.md, which describes the transformations performed on the datasets and describes the tidy dataset.

##The script run_analysis.R
The script run_analysis.R does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


To work, the dataset "UCI HAR Dataset" must be unzipped and should be in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset".
